feature - added a confimation when trying to delete and entry.

Running Task
-create a button to toggle light or dark mode.
-create tags in the treeview so you can find entries easier? (makes info more public possibly...)

Bugs to fix.
when you load an entry it automatically thinks the text entry has changed. adds a pop up before every load.
